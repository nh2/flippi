As of version 0.03, Flippi has support for scripts. Here're some example links to run them:

_[:RecentChanges|count|description:]

[:RecentChanges|count|description:]

_[:RecentChanges|count="20"|Recent Changes (count set to 20):]

[:RecentChanges|count="20"|Recent Changes (count set to 20):]

_[:RecentChanges||Recent Changes with no parameters:]

[:RecentChanges||Recent Changes with no parameters:]

_[:RecentChanges|count="40"|:]

[:RecentChanges|count="40"|:]

In the above examples, RecentChanges is a script, and count is an optional parameter that the RecentChanges script understands. Flippi doesn't currently come with a script that takes more than one parameter, but here's a hypothetical example:

_[:SomeScript|foo bar="baz" quux|This script does not exist:]
